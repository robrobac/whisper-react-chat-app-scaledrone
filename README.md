Whisper Chat App - WORK IN PROGRESS

# ABOUT

This is the Final Project for Algebra's Front-End Developer Education, which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.

# TASK
Task is to create a web chat application.
The technologies used to create the application are arbitrary,
as long as they meet all the requirements of the functional specification.

Functional specification:
It is necessary to create a functional user interface for chat participants and to upload the created code to GitHub.
The chat application should be able to:

- Create new text messages
- Send messages on "Enter" or "Send" button click (display them on the screen along with the author's name)
- Randomly select a color and/or name to identify each participant in the chat
- Connect to the Scaledrone service and successfully simulate a conversation among all active users

The Project is generally defined, which means that you have a lot of freedom in developing the solution.
It is even desirable that you add as many logical and possibly unspecified possibilities in the specification yourself.
Of course, you must not forget the minimum basic requirements listed in the brief task specification.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
