## TASK
Task was to create a web chat application.
The technologies used to create the application are arbitrary,
as long as they meet all the requirements of the functional specification.

It is necessary to create a functional user interface for chat participants and to upload the created code to GitHub.
The chat application should be able to:

- Create new text messages
- Send messages on "Enter" or "Send" button click (display them on the screen along with the author's name)
- Randomly select a color and/or name to identify each participant in the chat
- Connect to the Scaledrone service and successfully simulate a conversation among all active users

The Project is generally defined, which means that you have a lot of freedom in developing the solution.
It is even desirable that you add as many logical and possibly unspecified possibilities in the specification yourself.
Of course, you must not forget the minimum basic requirements listed in the brief task specification.
